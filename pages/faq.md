<!--__Zoom is saying I need an authorised account__

Because we are using our university's Zoom licence, Zoom will ask you to sign in and tell you that you need to have an authorised account. Any account sign in will allow you to access our seminars, but some will mean that you are autromatically placed in a waiting room. If this occurs we'll make sure to let you in swiftly. Please see the guide for non-Bath accounts [here](https://teachinghub.bath.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/accessing_zoom_meetings_externals.pdf).-->

**MS Teams is asking for a passcode and/or meeting ID**

Please use the following:\
Meeting ID: 393 527 089 878\
Passcode: dsm7py

**Do I need a paid account to view the seminars?**

No! Paywalls are not the vibe.

## Recordings

**Are the talks recorded?**

Unless a speaker specifically requests for their talk to be recorded, we are not recording any of these talks.
