## Carmen  
My mathematical interests lie within discrete probability with specific interests in interacting particle systems and random processes on both random and fixed structures. I am currently a PhD student in Statistical Applied Mathematics at Bath (SAMBa) as part of the 7th cohort. My current project is on the symbiotic contact process on random structures and is supervised by Marcel Ortgiese and Sarah Penington. My current area of research concerns the comparison of the critical values for both the symbiotic contact process and the contact process on Galton-Watson trees.
