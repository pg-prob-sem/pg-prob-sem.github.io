## Abstract

We consider a variant of the configuration model with an embedded community structure, where every vertex has an internal and an outgoing number of half edges. We pick a uniform matching of the half edges subject to the constraints that internal edges in each community are matched to each other and the proportion of half edges between communities $i$ and $j$ being $Q(i,j)$. We prove that a simple random walk on the resulting graph $G=(V,E)$ exhibits cutoff if and only if the product of the Cheeger constant of $Q$ times $\log\|V\|$ diverges. This is a joint work with [Perla Sousi](http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~ps422/) and [Jonathan Hermon](https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~jhermon/).
