## About Bas

[Bas Lodewijks](https://sites.google.com/view/bas-lodewijks/home) is a postdoc within the probability group of the Institut Camille Jordan at the University of Lyon and the University of Saint-Etienne, working with Dieter Mitsche. Previously, he completed his PhD within the probability group (Prob-L@b) of the University of Bath, supervised by [Marcel Ortgiese](https://people.bath.ac.uk/ma2mo/). 

His main interests are in random graph theory, particularly evolutionary and/or spatial random graph models.  Such models are not only interesting from a mathematical perspective, but also provide insights in networks in many real-world applications. 

He graduated the University of Technology in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, in 2018 after completing a Bachelor and Master of Science in Industrial and Applied Mathematics there. His master thesis was supervised by [Julia Komjathy](https://fa.ewi.tudelft.nl/~komjathy/).
