## Abstract
TBA

## About Martijn
Martijn very recently received his PhD at TU Eindhoven under the supervision of Remco van der Hofstad and Nelly Litvak. His research focuses on detecting communities in complex networks. Communities are groups of nodes that are better connected internally than externally. Such communities could, for example, correspond to groups of friends on social media or fields of study in citation networks. Another branch of his research concerns validating validation measure. For many machine learning tasks, there exist many measures to quantify the similarity between two outcomes. These measures are used to validate the performance of a machine learning algorithm by measuring the similarity between the outcome of the algorithm and the desired ('true') outcome. An important question is then to validate these measures.
