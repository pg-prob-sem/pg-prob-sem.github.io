title:  "Bas Lodewijks: A Study of the Random Recursive Tree"
teaser: "Bas will be discussing results for the random recursive tree - a random labelled tree of size n, sampled uniformly from all increasing trees of size n. "
meta_teaser: "The random recursive tree is a random labelled tree of size n, sampled uniformly from all increasing trees of size n (trees with increasing labels on paths away from the root). It is a classical model of randomly grown trees that has been thoroughly studied ever since its introduction in the 1980s and holds connections with many other discrete random objects. "
