He completed his undergraduate studies on Engineering Mathematics in the Universidad Autónoma de Chihuahua, in Chihuahua, México on 2020. During his undergrad, he developed an interest in computing and pure mathematics, in particular in probability theory and mathematical analysis. His current work is on the theoretical analysis of numerical schemes for SDEs and McKean-Vlasov SDEs with distributional drift. Additionally to his PhD project he works as a Tutor for The Brilliant Club, helping students from under-represented backgrounds to access higher education.
