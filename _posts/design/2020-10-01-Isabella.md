Passcode: dsm7py

## Abstract

We will introduce the multitype contact process on Z and present its construction. Starting the process from the Heaviside configuration (where the positive axis is occupied by one of the species and the negative, by the other) we define the interface of the process. We then proceed to a discussion regarding the tightness of the interface and the position of the interface for both the symmetric and the asymmetric case of the transmission rates.
