## About Speaker

Zs칩fia Talyig치s is a postdoc within the University of Vienna working with [Emmanuel Schertzer](https://homepage.univie.ac.at/emmanuel.schertzer/). Previously, she completed her PhD in the EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in [Statistical Applied Mathematics (SAMBa)](https://samba.ac.uk) at the University of Bath supervised by [Sarah Penington](https://people.bath.ac.uk/sp2355/) and [Matthew Roberts](https://people.bath.ac.uk/mir20/). Her thesis concerned a branching process with selection, which can be thought of as describing the evolution of a population under natural selection. The project mainly focused on characterising the genealogical properties of such a population under different conditions.
