## About Speaker

[Zs칩fia Talyig치s](https://homepage.univie.ac.at/zsofia.talyigas/) is a postdoc within the University of Vienna working with [Emmanuel Schertzer](https://homepage.univie.ac.at/emmanuel.schertzer/). Previously, she completed her PhD in the EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in [Statistical Applied Mathematics (SAMBa)](https://samba.ac.uk) at the University of Bath supervised by [Sarah Penington](https://people.bath.ac.uk/sp2355/) and [Matthew Roberts](https://people.bath.ac.uk/mir20/). Her research is in probability theory: she is interested in branching processes with selection; that is, in models that are related to the evolution of a population under natural selection. The most interesting questions in this topic concern the speed of evolution, the genealogical structure and the fitness profile of the population.
