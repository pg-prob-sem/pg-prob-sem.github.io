## Abstract
Interacting particle systems are countable systems of locally interacting Markov processes and are often used as toy models for stochastic phenomena with an underlying spatial structure. Even though the definition of an interacting particle system often looks very simple and the major technical issues of existence and uniqueness have long been settled, it is in general surprisingly difficult to say anything non-trivial about their behavior.
We study  the long-time behaviour of such systems on the $d$-dimensional hypercubic lattice, which admit at least one Gibbs measure as a time-stationary measure. Under some mild non-degeneracy conditions on the rates and the specification, we prove that one can use the relative entropy as a Lyapunov functional and thereby show that all possible limit points of the associated measure-valued dynamics are also Gibbs measures if the initial condition is translation-invariant. 
In the special case of reversible interacting particle systems on one- and two-dimensional lattices, we extend the method to non-translation invariant initial distributions and completely determine the phase portrait of the dynamics. This answers open questions on the possibility of time-periodic behaviour in two dimensions and on the connection between uniqueness of the invariant measure and ergodicity. This is based on joint work with Benedikt Jahnel.
